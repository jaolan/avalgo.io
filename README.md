## About

Avalgo.io is a play-to-earn coding platform where users solve coding-based questions to earn rewards.

## How it Works

To play and claim Avalgo rewards, you need an AvalgoPass NFT. These are currently free to mint (pay gas) and can be claimed from [avalgo.io](https://www.avalgo.io/).

Once you connect your wallet, you can answer coding and algorithm quesitons to earn AVAX rewards! Answering questions correctly will earn you a bounty - the harder the question, the larger the bounty! All rewards are paid in the native currency, AVAX - projects and protocols may contact to have their token paid out to AvalgoPass NFT holders for completing questions.

## More

Avalgo is currently on the Fuji Testnet, and was designed during the [Moralis x Avax Hackathon](https://moralis.io/avalanche-hackathon/).
